Perform an independent, read-only review of the complete fixed-base-to-branch diff against the supplied issue, spec, or plan. Do not read another review. Read `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, relevant docs and ADRs, then trace callers, persistence boundaries, and failure paths. Never edit or commit.

Try to falsify the implementation. Emphasize malformed or partial data, optimistic conflicts, identity/path confusion, source-of-truth duplication, JSON Canvas portability, host/widget isolation, unsafe content, async races, reload/offline behavior, accessibility, and browser-only gaps. Rerun applicable checks. On every revision, review the full updated diff again.

Report findings first by severity (`P0`–`P3`) with file/line evidence, a failure scenario, and the smallest correction. Then list open questions and testing gaps. If none are actionable, say so explicitly.
