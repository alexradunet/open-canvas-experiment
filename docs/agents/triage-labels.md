# Triage labels

The engineering skills use five canonical state roles. Each role maps directly to a GitHub label in this repository.

| Skill role | GitHub label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `needs-triage` | `needs-triage` | Maintainer evaluation is required |
| `needs-info` | `needs-info` | Waiting for specific reporter information |
| `ready-for-agent` | `ready-for-agent` | Fully specified and eligible for the human-steered visible-worker issue-to-PR flow |
| `ready-for-human` | `ready-for-human` | Requires human judgment or implementation |
| `wontfix` | `wontfix` | Will not be actioned |

Every triaged issue carries exactly one category label (`bug` or `enhancement`) and one state label. Remove the old state label when applying a new one. Do not infer that an unlabeled issue is ready for implementation.
