# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repository live in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alexradunet/balaur/issues). Use the `gh` CLI from this clone so repository resolution follows the configured remote.

## Conventions

- Create: `gh issue create --title "..." --body-file <file>`.
- Read: `gh issue view <number> --comments --json number,title,body,state,labels,author,comments`.
- List: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,comments` with appropriate label filters.
- Comment: `gh issue comment <number> --body-file <file>`.
- Apply or remove labels: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`.
- Close: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`.

Use temporary files outside the repository for multiline bodies when shell quoting would be fragile.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** External pull requests do not appear in routine triage discovery. An explicitly named PR may still be inspected with `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and pull requests. Resolve an ambiguous `#42` with `gh pr view 42`, falling back to `gh issue view 42`.

## Publishing and fetching

When a skill says to publish to the issue tracker, create a GitHub issue. When a skill says to fetch a ticket, read the full issue body, labels, author, and comments rather than relying on its title.

## Agent implementation

An issue labelled `ready-for-agent` is eligible for the visible-worker issue-to-PR workflow in `docs/agents/development-workflow.md`. User direction may explicitly override the label gate for one issue.

The human-steered lead creates the worktree and branch, starts visible workers, integrates results, pushes the non-main branch, and opens the pull request. Workers only inspect, edit, test, and commit inside their assigned worktree when explicitly directed by the lead. Workers must never merge the pull request or push directly to `main`.
