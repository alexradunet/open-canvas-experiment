# Life data: canonical files and a disposable in-memory index

Balaur's canonical-files-only v1 stores life data as readable files in a vault. JSON Canvas remains the spatial/document format; Markdown carries the operational fields that JSON Canvas does not define. The runtime index is derived state.

## Ownership

```text
.orbit/workspace.json  hierarchy, canvas metadata, cameras, JD metadata
canvases/*.canvas       canonical JSON Canvas 1.0 documents
tasks/*.md              task definitions and workflow state
habits/*.md             habit definitions
habit-logs/YYYY/*.md    append-only daily habit check-in events
journal/YYYY/*.md       journal entries by local date
events/*.md             calendar events
widgets/*.html          sandboxed file-node attachments
MemoryIndex             disposable runtime projection
```

The vault adapters share the same logical layout:

- `IndexedDbVault` is the browser default;
- `FsVault` is the Node filesystem reference adapter; and
- `MemoryVault` is the deterministic test adapter.

The vault is the only source of truth. `MemoryIndex` can be deleted and rebuilt from the vault without losing meaningful data. A persistent index, including SQLite, is deferred; it is not loaded or required by v1. OPFS-backed SQLite Wasm would require COOP/COEP headers that GitHub Pages cannot provide, which is why the default projection is in-memory JavaScript. Upgrading a legacy localStorage profile is a clean break and drops its old task workflow state.

Identity is separate from location: an entity's immutable `orbit-id` is its identity, its path is a locator, and a JSON Canvas node ID is a placement. A task can therefore have zero, one, or many `file`-node placements.

## Workspace sidecar and canvases

The sidecar is `.orbit/workspace.json`:

```json
{
  "format": "orbit-workspace",
  "version": 2,
  "rootId": "canvas-root",
  "activeId": "canvas-root",
  "johnnyDecimal": { "enabled": false, "entries": {} },
  "canvases": {
    "canvas-root": {
      "id": "canvas-root",
      "title": "Life OS",
      "path": "canvases/root.canvas",
      "parentId": null,
      "portalNodeId": null,
      "camera": { "x": 80, "y": 55, "zoom": 0.78 }
    }
  }
}
```

The sidecar stores metadata only. Each `path` must be a unique, safe `canvases/<name>.canvas` path; the root is always `canvases/root.canvas`. Parent and portal references must be valid and acyclic. The corresponding file must pass `isCanvas()` or it is loaded as a read-only repair placeholder with raw content retained.

A `.canvas` file must contain only standard JSON Canvas 1.0 structures. The shared validator requires `nodes` and `edges` arrays, unique non-empty IDs, standard node types (`text`, `file`, `link`, `group`), valid finite positive geometry, valid colors and optional fields, and edge endpoints that reference nodes. Canvas and edge IDs are globally unique within the document.

## Frontmatter contract

Orbit writes a constrained YAML-compatible frontmatter block. Values are quoted strings, finite numbers, booleans, enum tokens, valid dates/instants, or simple flow arrays. The parser knows only Orbit-owned flat fields. Unknown keys, comments, ordering, indentation, BOM, line endings, and Markdown body are preserved. Repository updates patch named fields and replace only the body bytes after the closing delimiter.

Every Orbit entity uses:

```md
---
orbit-schema: 1
orbit-type: <type>
...
---
Markdown body remains ordinary user content.
```

`orbit-schema` must be `1`; newer schemas are read-only and unsupported schemas are rejected. Required identity and timestamps are validated rather than inferred.

### Tasks: `tasks/*.md`

```md
---
orbit-schema: 1
orbit-type: task
orbit-id: "task-a1b2c3"
title: "Review monthly budget"
status: next
priority: 1
scheduled-on: "2026-07-22"
due-on: "2026-07-25"
completed-at: null
estimate-minutes: 45
recurrence: null
created-at: "2026-07-21T09:00:00Z"
updated-at: "2026-07-21T09:00:00Z"
---
Optional context and Markdown body.
```

Required fields are `orbit-id`, `title`, `status`, `created-at`, and `updated-at`. Task statuses are `inbox`, `next`, `scheduled`, `waiting`, `done`, and `cancelled`. `scheduled-on` expresses scheduling intent; `due-on` is a separate deadline. `completed-at`, priority, estimate, recurrence, and dates may be null when allowed by the contract.

`FileTaskRepository` creates, updates, completes, reopens, and deletes task files. It writes a standard `file` node for each requested placement and uses content-hash preconditions for edits and removals. Removing a placement does not remove the task; deleting everywhere removes all placements before the canonical file.

### Habits: `habits/*.md`

```md
---
orbit-schema: 1
orbit-type: habit
orbit-id: "habit-strength"
title: "Strength training"
frequency: weekly
weekdays: [1, 3, 5]
target: 3
unit: "sessions"
archived-at: null
created-at: "2026-07-21T09:00:00Z"
updated-at: "2026-07-21T09:00:00Z"
---
Habit context.
```

Required fields are `orbit-id`, `title`, `frequency`, `created-at`, and `updated-at`. Frequencies are `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly`. Weekdays are unique integers from 1 through 7. Check-ins are historical events, not an overwritten counter.

### Habit logs: `habit-logs/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

A daily log has a small identity frontmatter block and inert, constrained event comments in its body:

```md
---
orbit-schema: 1
orbit-type: habit-log
local-date: "2026-07-21"
---
<!-- orbit:habit-entry id=entry-a1 habit=habit-strength status=done value=1 at=2026-07-21T06:30:00Z -->
```

Each `habit-entry` requires unique `id`, `habit`, `status`, `value`, and `at` attributes. Status is `done`, `skipped`, or `missed`; value is finite; `at` is a valid ISO instant. Malformed markers invalidate the source file rather than creating a malformed projection row. `FileHabitRepository.checkIn()` appends events and derives the local date using the intended timezone.

### Journals: `journal/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

```md
---
orbit-schema: 1
orbit-type: journal
orbit-id: "journal-2026-07-21"
local-date: "2026-07-21"
created-at: "2026-07-21T09:00:00Z"
updated-at: "2026-07-21T09:00:00Z"
---
Journal body.
```

The required fields are `orbit-id`, `local-date`, `created-at`, and `updated-at`. `FileJournalRepository` keeps one canonical file per local date and preserves frontmatter/body formatting on updates.

### Calendar events: `events/*.md`

```md
---
orbit-schema: 1
orbit-type: calendar-event
orbit-id: "event-a1b2c3"
title: "Dentist"
starts-at: "2026-07-22T14:00:00+01:00"
ends-at: "2026-07-22T15:00:00+01:00"
local-date: "2026-07-22"
timezone: "Europe/London"
all-day: false
source: orbit
created-at: "2026-07-21T09:00:00Z"
updated-at: "2026-07-21T09:00:00Z"
---
Event notes.
```

Required fields are `orbit-id`, `title`, `starts-at`, `local-date`, `timezone`, `created-at`, and `updated-at`. Instants must be real ISO 8601 timestamps; timezones must be valid IANA names. The local date is explicit and is not obtained by slicing a UTC timestamp.

## Date and time conventions

These conventions apply to every repository and projection:

- local dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` and must be real calendar dates;
- instants are ISO 8601 strings with a timezone offset or `Z`;
- calendar timezones are IANA timezone names; and
- `scheduled-on` and `due-on` are independent task fields.

`localDateForInstant()` uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with the intended IANA timezone. Tests cover invalid dates, invalid instants, invalid zones, and timezone-boundary behavior; the browser boundary still needs browser verification.

## Runtime index

`LifeIndexer` builds source records for every vault file. It records media type, path, content hash, byte size, entity type/id, parse status, and diagnostics. Untyped Markdown and opaque attachments can remain valid source files; malformed Orbit entities and invalid canvases are diagnostics.

Typed projections include:

- tasks with workflow and temporal fields;
- habits with definition fields;
- journals keyed by local date;
- calendar events keyed by `orbit-id`;
- immutable habit-entry rows from daily log markers; and
- placements derived by scanning canvas `file` nodes that reference entity files.

Duplicate `orbit-id` files never produce a winner: every conflicting typed projection and placement is suppressed and each conflicting path receives a `DUPLICATE_ID` diagnostic. Missing file-node targets, parse failures, and index drift are diagnostics. `index-integrity.js` compares canonical files, hashes, typed rows, placements, and diagnostics and can purge/rebuild the index.

Cold rebuild uses `LifeIndexer.rebuild()`. Warm updates use vault revisions and `LifeIndexer.reconcileWarm()`, preserving old-path ancestry for moves and applying each projection through `MemoryIndex.transaction()`. `MemoryIndex.transaction()` rolls back the complete projection, diagnostics, and state for that projection on failure. The browser exposes `window.orbitCanvas.rebuildIndex()` as a recovery command.

`LifeQuery` is the application-facing facade. It returns consistent camelCase objects for:

- open/today tasks, with status/date filters and stable priority/date/title ordering;
- tasks by status;
- habits with latest daily state and a done streak;
- a journal for one local date; and
- events in a half-open instant range.

The index is not exported as a separate source of truth and can be reconstructed from files at every boot.

## Vault writes and conflicts

All adapters support safe normalized paths, case-fold collision detection, content hashes, revisions, and optimistic `expectedHash` preconditions. `FsVault` rejects symlinked components and uses serialized writes, temporary siblings, no-replace hard-link commits, and restore rollback protection. `IndexedDbVault` keeps file contents, metadata, changes, and case-fold keys in IndexedDB; the Service Worker never caches those records.

Frontmatter and body updates are preservation-first. If an external edit changes the expected hash, the repository refuses the write instead of silently overwriting it. Missing or malformed canvas files are read-only until repaired explicitly.

## Version-2 whole-space backup

`storage/workspace-backup.js` exports a deterministic bundle shaped like:

```json
{
  "format": "orbit-workspace",
  "version": 2,
  "exportedAt": "2026-07-21T09:00:00Z",
  "workspace": { "format": "orbit-workspace", "version": 2, "rootId": "canvas-root", "canvases": {} },
  "files": [
    { "path": "canvases/root.canvas", "mediaType": "application/jsoncanvas+json", "text": "{\"nodes\":[],\"edges\":[]}\n" },
    { "path": "tasks/review-monthly-budget-task-a1b2c3.md", "mediaType": "text/markdown", "text": "---\\n..." }
  ]
}
```

The sidecar is in `workspace`; files are raw text so frontmatter and line endings remain inspectable. Export validates every canvas and reports unreadable files. Import rejects version-1 bundles, requires an empty staging vault, validates every path/canvas/file-node reference/entity before the first write, writes files with `expectedHash: null`, and leaves activation to the caller after indexing succeeds.

A single `.canvas` export is interoperable JSON Canvas but is not a complete life backup when its file references are not bundled. A version-2 whole-space bundle is the portable recovery format.

## Verification status

The explicit storage command in `AGENTS.md` passes **165 Node tests** across phase1, phase2, phase3, phase4, phase4-backup, phase5, phase7, phase8, phase9, phase10, and phase-query. This verifies the platform-neutral codecs, repositories, adapters, indexing, queries, backup validation, and audit logic.

Browser verification is still pending for IndexedDB persistence/restore and quota behavior, vault-first boot and first-render timing, task create/complete/Today interaction, export/import round-trip in a real profile, offline reload and cache upgrades, timezone boundaries in browser locale behavior, and repair affordances for malformed files.
