# Proposed architecture

## Recommendation

Use a **standards-first web application with no UI framework**, package the same static application with **Tauri 2** for desktop, and optionally use Capacitor on mobile.

The platform already provides the important primitives: ES modules, Custom Elements, DOM templates, CSS custom properties, Pointer Events, SVG, Canvas 2D, WebGL, IndexedDB, Service Workers, Web Workers, `dialog`, `popover`, and `EventTarget`. An infinite canvas benefits from direct control over these APIs rather than a virtual DOM. Tauri adds filesystem access, menus, notifications, and SQLite without replacing the browser renderer.

The static app now starts from `main.js` as an ES module and registers a same-origin Service Worker. Its versioned application-shell cache includes local modules, styles, fonts, SQLite Wasm, icons, and the sample widget. Runtime requests use the network when available and fall back to this cache when offline; cross-origin AI provider requests are never intercepted. The web app manifest makes the same shell installable without introducing a build pipeline. Lifecycle and validation details are in [offline.md](offline.md).

## Core principle: separate document truth from indexed views

JSON Canvas should be the portable document and spatial layer, but not the only application database.

A task needs fields that JSON Canvas 1.0 does not define: due date, status, recurrence, completion time, reminders, and calendar links. Putting those fields directly on a node would produce useful but non-standard extensions. Encoding all metadata in Markdown is portable but expensive and fragile to query.

A practical model is:

1. `.canvas` documents remain valid JSON Canvas 1.0.
2. Stable node IDs link nodes to records in a local SQLite index.
3. Tasks can originate from Markdown checkboxes and be indexed automatically.
4. Optional app metadata is stored in a sidecar file or database, never required to open the canvas.
5. Calendar, Today, and task-list screens are projections of the same indexed records, not separate sources of truth.

For sync, use immutable operations and a document revision rather than writing whole files from several clients concurrently.

### Implemented storage bridge

The browser prototype now vendors official SQLite Wasm and initializes a versioned life database in `storage/life-store.js`. On GitHub Pages it uses SQLite's `:localStorage:` kvvfs because the host cannot provide the COOP/COEP headers required by the official OPFS worker build. The database indexes canvases and nodes and provides repositories for tasks, habits, habit entries, journals, calendar events, and activity history. Portable task-marker nodes are reconciled into SQLite and projected through both canvas cards and the Today dashboard.

Whole-workspace backup serializes those tables as normalized JSON rather than coupling exports to a particular SQLite binary/VFS. The same store contract can move to Worker + OPFS or native Tauri SQLite. Details are in [life-data.md](life-data.md).

### Canonical vault bridge (Phase 4b, in progress)

ADR-0001 makes canonical files the source of truth and SQLite a rebuildable index. The persistence foundation is implemented and Node-tested in `storage/`:

- `storage/workspace-vault.js` writes the metadata-only sidecar (`.orbit/workspace.json`) plus one independently-valid `.canvas` file per canvas, with optimistic-concurrency saves, a serialized write queue, and missing/invalid-file diagnostics;
- `storage/workspace-backup.js` produces and restores the version-2 whole-space `.orbit.json` bundle (sidecar + raw files, never a SQLite snapshot);
- `storage/indexeddb-vault.js` is the browser vault adapter; `storage/memory-vault.js` is the test adapter;
- `storage/life-indexer.js` projects canonical files into the schema-version-2 index tables.

`app.js` now imports the vault modules and runs a transitional bridge: on load it migrates the `localStorage` workspace into the IndexedDB vault and dual-writes every save to it. The app still boots synchronously from `localStorage`, so there is no startup regression and the vault is currently a write-only canonical mirror. Adopting the vault as the boot source (vault-first reads) and retiring the `localStorage` workspace load are the remaining browser-verified async-startup cutover and have not shipped. The same logic is exercised against `MemoryVault` by `storage/phase4.test.js` and `storage/phase4-backup.test.js`.

## Nested canvases and infinite zoom

A large space can contain an arbitrary hierarchy of smaller canvases without extending JSON Canvas:

- every level is an independent, valid JSON Canvas 1.0 document;
- a parent represents a child with a standard `file` node whose path is `canvases/<id>.canvas`;
- Orbit renders those resolvable file nodes as portal cards with live miniature previews;
- double-clicking, choosing **Open**, or zooming over a portal past 220% enters it;
- zooming out at the minimum scale returns to the parent, while breadcrumbs and the canvas list allow direct switching;
- parent ID, portal node ID, title, and camera state live in a workspace sidecar rather than private node fields.

The current static prototype persists that workspace wrapper in `localStorage`. A filesystem-backed application should store the root `.canvas`, child files under `canvases/`, and a small sidecar manifest. This preserves direct interoperability: another JSON Canvas editor can still open every level independently, even if it does not understand Orbit's hierarchy navigation.

### Johnny Decimal projection

Johnny Decimal is implemented as a constrained projection of the same hierarchy rather than a new node type:

- the root canvas is the index;
- area records validate ranges such as `10-19`;
- category records must fall inside their area's range, such as `11`;
- items use category-scoped IDs from `11.01` through `11.99`;
- area, category, and complex-item canvases are ordinary file-node portals with readable paths;
- simple item notes encode their ID in a Markdown heading and an inert `<!-- orbit:jd ... -->` comment;
- a sidecar index rejects duplicates, provides direct lookup, and orders the canvas tree numerically.

A whole-space `.orbit.json` backup contains that sidecar plus all of the independent JSON Canvas documents. Single `.canvas` import/export remains available for interoperability. New installations seed this model with a fictional age-30 life index (9 areas, 17 categories, and 34 item notes); the template is ordinary workspace data and can be replaced or edited completely.

## Suggested source layout

```text
src/
  components/          Custom Elements such as orbit-canvas and orbit-assistant
  canvas/              Camera, geometry, hit testing, commands, undo/redo
  json-canvas/         Validation, parse/serialize, migrations
  domain/              Tasks, recurrence, projects, calendar event models
  storage/             File System Access API, IndexedDB, SQLite adapters
  sync/                Operation log and sync adapters
  widget-runtime/      Sandboxed HTML cards and addressable partial updates
  ai-operations/       Context builder, validation, and plan previews
  workers/             Search, indexing, and expensive layout work
app/                    HTML entry point, global styles, icons, manifest
desktop/                Optional Tauri shell
```

Modules communicate through explicit commands and `EventTarget`/`CustomEvent`, not through framework state. Custom Elements should be used where lifecycle encapsulation is useful, not as a requirement for every small DOM fragment. The current prototype intentionally runs directly as static files with no package install or build step.

## Renderer choice

Start with a hybrid renderer:

- DOM cards for accessible text, forms, Markdown, links, and editing
- SVG or Canvas 2D for edges, selection decorations, and distant low-detail nodes
- viewport culling so only visible cards are mounted
- a spatial index such as RBush once documents become large

Avoid adopting a generic graph library too early. Most graph tools assume node-to-node diagrams, whereas this product needs free spatial composition, groups, rich text, files, and life-management interactions.

## Command model

All changes should be represented as commands:

```ts
type CanvasCommand =
  | { type: "node.move"; ids: string[]; delta: Point }
  | { type: "node.resize"; id: string; bounds: Rect }
  | { type: "node.update"; id: string; patch: Partial<CanvasNode> }
  | { type: "edge.create"; edge: CanvasEdge }
  | { type: "task.complete"; taskId: string; completedAt: string };
```

Commands provide one place for validation, autosave, undo/redo, activity history, and eventual sync. Model output must compile into the same commands rather than directly manipulating component state or the host DOM.

Live HTML/WebGL cards and the adaptation of `partialupdate` are described in [generative-canvas.md](generative-canvas.md).

## Delivery phases

1. **Canvas foundation** — standards-based editor, JSON Canvas import/export, command stack, local files.
2. **Life layer** — task extraction, Today view, projects, recurring tasks, SQLite index.
3. **Time layer** — calendar projection, drag-to-schedule, reminders, ICS/CalDAV adapter.
4. **Desktop** — Tauri packaging, filesystem watcher, deep links, system notifications.
5. **Sync/mobile** — operation log, conflict strategy, then Capacitor or a native renderer based on validated mobile needs.
