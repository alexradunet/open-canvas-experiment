# Generative canvas and live cards

Balaur's shipped security boundary connects standard JSON Canvas file nodes, sandboxed HTML/WebGL cards, and structured AI operations. The addressable-region ideas in Phil Holden's MIT-licensed [`partialupdate`](https://github.com/philholden/partialupdate) experiment are reference material, not a permission to execute generated host-page code.

## Canonical life data and AI context

AI changes to life entities use the file repositories. A task, habit, journal entry, or calendar event is a canonical Markdown file; the in-memory index is only a disposable query projection. AI operations must not write projection rows or invent task-marker nodes. A task placement is a standard JSON Canvas `file` node, and removing a placement does not remove the canonical entity.

When an incoming AI context edge targets a canonical entity `file` node, Balaur preloads the referenced Markdown file and supplies its parsed title/body rather than treating the path as the content. Missing or unreadable files produce a diagnostic and a bounded fallback; they are never silently treated as the file body.

## Keep the host document standard

JSON Canvas 1.0 has no `html`, `widget`, or `webgl` node type. Adding one would make the document an application-specific dialect. Instead, Balaur treats a standard file node whose `file` ends in `.html` as a live card:

```json
{
  "id": "focus-orbit",
  "type": "file",
  "file": "widgets/focus-orbit.html",
  "x": 100,
  "y": 100,
  "width": 480,
  "height": 290,
  "color": "5"
}
```

Other JSON Canvas clients still see a valid file attachment. Balaur renders it in an iframe with `sandbox="allow-scripts"`. HTML, CSS, SVG, Canvas 2D, and direct WebGL can all run inside that boundary. Balaur does not load a third-party rendering engine; `widgets/focus-orbit.html` uses WebGL2 shaders and buffers directly, keeps a CSS fallback, caps device-pixel ratio, honors reduced motion and page visibility, and handles context loss.

The sandbox deliberately omits `allow-same-origin`, top navigation, popups, forms, downloads, camera, and microphone permissions. A future desktop build should serve workspace attachments through an app protocol rather than grant widgets direct filesystem access.

## Partial updates

The useful idea from `partialupdate` is addressable UI regions, not unrestricted access to the application DOM. A live card can expose regions such as:

```text
/nodes/focus-orbit/style
/nodes/focus-orbit/content
/nodes/focus-orbit/data/progress
```

The AI can return a `<template for="…">` update for one region without regenerating the card or canvas. The card runtime receives updates over `postMessage`; only the sandbox applies generated HTML/CSS/JS.

For canvas data, use structured operations rather than HTML templates:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "node.update",
    "id": "goal-1",
    "patch": { "text": "# Run 10K\n\n- [x] Choose a plan" }
  },
  {
    "type": "theme.set",
    "theme": "warm"
  }
]
```

The current demo exposes this boundary as:

```js
window.orbitCanvas.getDocument()
window.orbitCanvas.getSummary()
window.orbitCanvas.applyOperations(operations)
```

All operations are allowlisted and the resulting document is validated before commit.

## Prompt-first AI notes

An AI note is a one-shot generation flow. Balaur first opens a native `<dialog>` for the question, calls the configured provider only after submission, and adds the resulting Markdown as an ordinary JSON Canvas text node. No placeholder node is created when the dialog is cancelled or the request fails.

## Reactive AI operator cards

An AI operator remains a standard JSON Canvas text node. Balaur recognizes the existing portable Markdown compatibility marker rather than introducing a custom node type:

```markdown
<!-- orbit:ai-card -->
# Weekly synthesis
Summarize the connected notes and recommend the next action.
```

Incoming edges define its context. The operator sends the prompt and connected node content to the configured provider, creates a standard text node for the result, and connects it with an edge labeled `AI output`. Subsequent executions update that same note instead of generating duplicates.

Balaur computes signatures from the prompt, incoming edge set, and input content. Content or connection changes queue a debounced regeneration. Coordinates and card dimensions do not trigger requests. Directed cycles pause automatic execution, and an update arriving during a request queues one follow-up run.

This representation remains readable in other JSON Canvas clients: they see ordinary text nodes and edges even if they do not understand the compatibility marker.

## AI request flow

1. The app derives a compact context: visible nodes, selected nodes, nearby relationships, canonical file bodies, open tasks, and available widget regions.
2. The model returns a typed plan, not executable host-page code.
3. The app validates the plan and shows a human-readable preview.
4. The user approves changes.
5. Canvas changes apply through validated operations; life changes call the canonical file repositories, which reindex after writing.
6. Widget-region changes are sent to the relevant sandbox through `postMessage`.

The operation and repository wiring is present in the static application. Browser verification of file-node context resolution, AI-assisted task flows, and failure handling remains pending.

The model should receive only the relevant canvas slice by default, not every attachment in a workspace.

## Canvas styling

Theme state is not part of JSON Canvas 1.0. Store it in optional workspace metadata:

```json
{
  "document": "life.canvas",
  "theme": {
    "preset": "warm",
    "tokens": {
      "canvas.background": "#15110e",
      "card.radius": 10,
      "edge.width": 1.5
    }
  }
}
```

Models should update validated design tokens. Do not let a model inject arbitrary CSS into the host app. Arbitrary CSS is acceptable only inside a sandboxed live card.

## Provider modes

The GitHub Pages demo supports two dependency-free modes:

1. local canvas commands with no network access;
2. direct browser calls to an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint.

Mistral can be configured with `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` and a model such as `mistral-small-latest`. Provider metadata is saved locally. The secret remains in `sessionStorage` by default, or in `localStorage` only when the user explicitly enables **Remember API key**.

Direct client access is useful for a personal proof of concept, but any script running under the application's origin can potentially read a browser-stored key. A distributed multi-user product should use a trusted backend or local model service. The Cloudflare Worker and Durable Object architecture in `partialupdate` remains a useful reference for streaming, authorization, rate limits, and multi-user sessions.

## Required hardening

- Content Security Policy for host and widget documents
- strict `postMessage` schema and source checks
- operation count and payload-size limits
- model/tool rate limits and spending limits
- no implicit network permission for generated widgets
- user confirmation for deletions, bulk updates, and external requests
- transaction log, undo, and recovery after interrupted writes
- sanitize generated HTML even inside the sandbox to reduce phishing and resource abuse

`partialupdate` itself warns that generated scripts can submit prompts or requests in loops. Isolation and budgets are product requirements, not later polish.
