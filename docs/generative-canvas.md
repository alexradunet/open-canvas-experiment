# Generative canvas and live cards

This is the proposed bridge between JSON Canvas, live HTML/WebGL cards, and the ideas in Phil Holden's MIT-licensed [`partialupdate`](https://github.com/philholden/partialupdate) experiment.

## Keep the host document standard

JSON Canvas 1.0 has no `html`, `widget`, or `webgl` node type. Adding one would make the document an application-specific dialect. Instead, Orbit treats a standard file node whose `file` ends in `.html` as a live card:

```json
{
  "id": "focus-orbit",
  "type": "file",
  "file": "widgets/focus-orbit.html",
  "x": 100,
  "y": 100,
  "width": 480,
  "height": 290,
  "color": "5"
}
```

Other JSON Canvas clients still see a valid file attachment. Orbit renders it in an iframe with `sandbox="allow-scripts"`. HTML, CSS, SVG, Canvas 2D, and direct WebGL can all run inside that boundary. Orbit does not load a third-party rendering engine; `widgets/focus-orbit.html` uses WebGL2 shaders and buffers directly, keeps a CSS fallback, caps device-pixel ratio, honors reduced motion and page visibility, and handles context loss.

The sandbox deliberately omits `allow-same-origin`, top navigation, popups, forms, downloads, camera, and microphone permissions. A future desktop build should serve workspace attachments through an app protocol rather than grant widgets direct filesystem access.

## Partial updates

The useful idea from `partialupdate` is addressable UI regions, not unrestricted access to the application DOM. A live card can expose regions such as:

```text
/nodes/focus-orbit/style
/nodes/focus-orbit/content
/nodes/focus-orbit/data/progress
```

The AI can return a `<template for="…">` update for one region without regenerating the card or canvas. The card runtime receives updates over `postMessage`; only the sandbox applies generated HTML/CSS/JS.

For canvas data, use structured operations rather than HTML templates:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "node.update",
    "id": "goal-1",
    "patch": { "text": "# Run 10K\n\n- [x] Choose a plan" }
  },
  {
    "type": "theme.set",
    "theme": "warm"
  }
]
```

The current demo exposes this boundary as:

```js
window.orbitCanvas.getDocument()
window.orbitCanvas.getSummary()
window.orbitCanvas.applyOperations(operations)
```

All operations are allowlisted and the resulting document is validated before commit.

## Prompt-first AI notes

An AI note is a one-shot generation flow. Orbit first opens a native `<dialog>` for the question, calls the configured provider only after submission, and adds the resulting Markdown as an ordinary JSON Canvas text node. No placeholder node is created when the dialog is cancelled or the request fails.

## Reactive AI operator cards

An AI operator remains a standard JSON Canvas text node. Orbit recognizes a portable Markdown marker rather than introducing a custom node type:

```markdown
<!-- orbit:ai-card -->
# Weekly synthesis
Summarize the connected notes and recommend the next action.
```

Incoming edges define its context. The operator sends the prompt and connected node content to the configured provider, creates a standard text node for the result, and connects it with an edge labeled `AI output`. Subsequent executions update that same note instead of generating duplicates.

Orbit computes signatures from the prompt, incoming edge set, and input content. Content or connection changes queue a debounced regeneration. Coordinates and card dimensions do not trigger requests. Directed cycles pause automatic execution, and an update arriving during a request queues one follow-up run.

This representation remains readable in other JSON Canvas clients: they see ordinary text nodes and edges even if they do not understand Orbit's marker.

## AI request flow

1. The app derives a compact context: visible nodes, selected nodes, nearby relationships, open tasks, and available widget regions.
2. The model returns a typed plan, not executable host-page code.
3. The app validates the plan and shows a human-readable preview.
4. The user approves changes.
5. A single transaction applies the plan and records an inverse transaction for undo.
6. Widget-region changes are sent to the relevant sandbox through `postMessage`.

The model should receive only the relevant canvas slice by default, not every attachment in a workspace.

## Canvas styling

Theme state is not part of JSON Canvas 1.0. Store it in optional workspace metadata:

```json
{
  "document": "life.canvas",
  "theme": {
    "preset": "warm",
    "tokens": {
      "canvas.background": "#15110e",
      "card.radius": 10,
      "edge.width": 1.5
    }
  }
}
```

Models should update validated design tokens. Do not let a model inject arbitrary CSS into the host app. Arbitrary CSS is acceptable only inside a sandboxed live card.

## Provider modes

The GitHub Pages demo supports two dependency-free modes:

1. local canvas commands with no network access;
2. direct browser calls to an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint.

Mistral can be configured with `https://api.mistral.ai/v1` and a model such as `mistral-small-latest`. Provider metadata is saved locally. The secret remains in `sessionStorage` by default, or in `localStorage` only when the user explicitly enables **Remember API key**.

Direct client access is useful for a personal proof of concept, but any script running under the application's origin can potentially read a browser-stored key. A distributed multi-user product should use a trusted backend or local model service. The Cloudflare Worker and Durable Object architecture in `partialupdate` remains a useful reference for streaming, authorization, rate limits, and multi-user sessions.

## Required hardening

- Content Security Policy for host and widget documents
- strict `postMessage` schema and source checks
- operation count and payload-size limits
- model/tool rate limits and spending limits
- no implicit network permission for generated widgets
- user confirmation for deletions, bulk updates, and external requests
- transaction log, undo, and recovery after interrupted writes
- sanitize generated HTML even inside the sandbox to reduce phishing and resource abuse

`partialupdate` itself warns that generated scripts can submit prompts or requests in loops. Isolation and budgets are product requirements, not later polish.
