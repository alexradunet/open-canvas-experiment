# Balaur — life on a canvas

A small, standalone proof of concept for a local-first life-management app whose primary interface and storage format is an infinite [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/) canvas.

## What the PoC includes

- Infinite canvas with pan, centered zoom, fit-to-view, and minimap
- Nested sub-canvases with live previews, breadcrumbs, switching, and infinite zoom navigation
- Johnny Decimal areas, categories, and items with automatic IDs, validation, numeric sorting, and direct lookup
- Draggable and resizable text, link, file, group, and sub-canvas portal nodes
- Goals, projects, habits, ideas, and notes represented with standard JSON Canvas fields
- Portable task cards backed by canonical Markdown files for status, scheduling, due dates, and priority
- A Today dashboard for planned, overdue, inbox/next, and completed work
- Obsidian-style side handles for dragging connections directly between cards, plus connect mode
- Markdown cards and task checkboxes
- Inspector for content, geometry, colors, and edge routing
- Sandboxed HTML/CSS/Canvas/WebGL cards represented as standard file nodes
- Balaur, a canvas-aware familiar with local tools or a client-side OpenAI-compatible provider
- Prompt-first AI notes that generate Markdown directly onto the canvas
- Reactive AI operator cards: connected nodes become inputs and generated notes refresh when inputs change
- Library filters
- Browser-local canonical-file persistence through an IndexedDB vault, with an in-memory query index rebuilt at boot
- JSON Canvas `.canvas` import/export and whole-space version-2 `.orbit.json` file-bundle backup/restore
- Installable offline shell with a web app manifest and Service Worker
- No package install, CDN, build step, or runtime database dependency
- An application-local Balaur token and motion system with self-hosted fonts

## Run locally

Start the dependency-free Node server:

```bash
node server.mjs
```

Then open <http://localhost:4173>. Set `PORT` or `HOST` to override the defaults, for example `PORT=4187 node server.mjs`. Service Workers are available on localhost, so after the first successful load the application shell also works offline.

## Controls

| Action | Control |
|---|---|
| Pan | Hold `Space` and drag, middle-drag, or use the hand tool |
| Zoom | Mouse wheel, `+`, or `-` |
| Enter sub-canvas | Double-click its portal, choose **Open**, or zoom over it past 220% |
| Return to parent | Zoom all the way out, choose a breadcrumb, or press `Alt + ↑` |
| Fit view | `0` |
| Add note | Double-click empty canvas or press `N` and click |
| Connect | Drag any side handle to another card, or press `C` and select two nodes |
| Select | `V` |
| Delete | `Delete` / `Backspace` |
| Switch workspace view | Select **Canvas** or **Today** in the header |
| Add task | Select **＋ Add → Task** on the canvas action bar, or **Add task** in Today |
| Open Johnny Decimal index | Select **JD** beside Canvases or press `Ctrl/Cmd + K` |
| Export current canvas | `Ctrl/Cmd + S` |
| Export all canvases | Select **Export whole space** in the sidebar |

## Johnny Decimal spaces

A new browser profile opens with a pre-seeded fictional life index for **Alex, a 30-year-old man**. Existing spaces can load it from **JD → Load starter** after exporting a backup; loading the starter replaces the canonical vault and reseeds the same task cards used on first run.

Select **JD** beside the Canvases heading. Balaur determines the next valid level from the selected parent:

```text
Index
└── 10–19 — Personal          area
    └── 11 — Finance          category
        ├── 11.01 — Budget    item note
        └── 11.02 — Taxes     item canvas
```

The starter includes 9 areas, 17 categories, 34 practical item notes, and 9 task cards covering life admin, health and fitness, career, money, home systems, relationships, learning, hobbies, travel, and archives. It is an editable example rather than personal, financial, or medical advice.

Area, category, and canvas-item portals remain standard JSON Canvas file nodes. Item notes store their identifier in a harmless Markdown comment and heading. IDs are checked for the correct parent range, duplicates are rejected, and the canvas hierarchy is sorted numerically. The same dialog provides direct **Go to ID** navigation.

## Tasks and Today

A task is a canonical Markdown file placed on one or more canvases through standard JSON Canvas `file` nodes:

```md
---
orbit-schema: 1
orbit-type: task
orbit-id: "task-a1b2c3"
title: "Review monthly budget"
status: next
scheduled-on: "2026-07-22"
due-on: "2026-07-25"
---
Task context remains ordinary Markdown.
```

The Markdown file owns workflow status, priority, planned date, due date, estimate, recurrence, and completion time. A canvas node ID is only a placement; removing one placement does not remove the task. The runtime index is rebuilt from canonical files and is never the source of truth.

Use the task inspector to edit metadata, or switch to **Today** for planned today, overdue, inbox/next, and completed work. Quick capture schedules a task for the current date while the full task dialog can place it in any nested canvas.

## Canonical files and queries

Balaur stores `.canvas` documents, `.md` life entities, and the `.orbit/workspace.json` sidecar in an IndexedDB vault in the browser. At boot, `LifeIndexer` projects those files into a disposable in-memory index and `LifeQuery` serves Today, calendar, habits, journals, and task filtering. Deleting or rebuilding the index loses no user data. Upgrading a legacy localStorage profile is a clean break: its old task workflow state is not migrated.

A persistent index is a deferred optimization, not a v1 dependency. OPFS-backed SQLite Wasm requires COOP/COEP headers that GitHub Pages cannot provide, so the static app uses the pure-JavaScript in-memory projection. Whole-space version-2 export/import preserves the sidecar and raw logical vault files rather than a database snapshot.

The vault-first wiring is implemented but browser-pending verification covers IndexedDB persistence, vault-first reload, task create/complete/Today UI behavior, export/import round-trip, offline reload, and timezone boundaries. See [`docs/life-data.md`](docs/life-data.md) for file contracts and repositories, [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for ownership, and [`docs/offline.md`](docs/offline.md) for shell caching and validation.

## Connect an AI provider

Open **Ask Balaur → ⚙ AI provider settings**. For Mistral, use:

```text
API base URL: https://api.mistral.ai/v1
Model:        mistral-small-latest
API key:      your Mistral API key
```

The static app calls the provider directly with `fetch()` using its OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint. The model receives the current canvas and proposes typed operations; changes are validated and require confirmation before being applied.

### AI notes

Select **＋ Add → AI note** on the canvas action bar. Balaur asks for your prompt before creating anything, sends it directly to the configured provider, and places the Markdown response near the center of the current view as a standard JSON Canvas text node.

### AI operator cards

1. Add an **AI operator** via **＋ Add** on the canvas action bar.
2. Edit its instructions in the inspector.
3. Connect input notes into the operator: select the connect tool, click an input, then click the AI card.
4. It runs after the connection is added; use **Run now** whenever you want a manual refresh.

The operator creates a standard text note and a labeled `AI output` connection. Changes to an input note are debounced and regenerate the same output note automatically. Connection cycles pause automatic execution to prevent request loops.

By default, the key lives in `sessionStorage` for the current tab. Enabling **Remember API key** places it in `localStorage`. This client-only mode is intended for personal testing on a trusted device.

## Data model

Each canvas remains a JSON Canvas 1.0 document with only the top-level `nodes` and `edges` arrays. A sub-canvas portal is a standard file node pointing to a child document under `canvases/`; Johnny Decimal portals use readable paths such as `canvases/11-finance.canvas`. Balaur's browser-local workspace sidecar tracks hierarchy, titles, Johnny Decimal identifiers, and camera positions without adding private fields to canvas objects.

**Export .canvas** exports the currently open level. **Export whole space** produces a version-2 `.orbit.json` file bundle containing the sidecar, every standards-compliant canvas document, and canonical Markdown/attachment files; the normal Import action restores either format. Version-1 bundles are intentionally rejected in canonical-files-only v1.

Life-management meaning is encoded portably:

- text and Markdown task lists in text nodes
- preset canvas colors as lightweight categories
- groups as areas of focus or time horizons
- edges as dependencies and relationships

App-specific state such as viewport, filters, and UI selection is not added to exported documents.

## Direction for a full application

This project is intentionally built with browser standards and no UI framework or runtime dependencies. A production app can continue in that direction with:

- ES modules, Custom Elements, DOM templates, CSS custom properties, Pointer Events, SVG, Canvas, and direct WebGL
- a command-based canvas engine for selection, geometry, JSON Canvas updates, undo, and sync
- a versioned Service Worker application shell, IndexedDB/OPFS, and the File System Access API in the browser
- **Tauri 2** for a small desktop app with filesystem access and an adapter-compatible future persistent index, if needed
- **Capacitor** as an optional mobile shell around the same web application
- `.canvas` and Markdown files as the portable formats while the in-memory task/calendar projections remain disposable runtime state
