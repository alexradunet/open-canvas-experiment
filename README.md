# Orbit — life on a canvas

A small, standalone proof of concept for a life-management app whose primary interface and storage format is an infinite [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/) canvas.

![JSON Canvas 1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/JSON_Canvas-1.0-7ee0a1)

## What the PoC includes

- Infinite canvas with pan, centered zoom, fit-to-view, and minimap
- Nested sub-canvases with live previews, breadcrumbs, switching, and infinite zoom navigation
- Johnny Decimal areas, categories, and items with automatic IDs, validation, numeric sorting, and direct lookup
- Draggable and resizable text, link, file, group, and sub-canvas portal nodes
- Goals, projects, habits, ideas, and notes represented with standard JSON Canvas fields
- Obsidian-style side handles for dragging connections directly between cards, plus connect mode
- Markdown cards and task checkboxes
- Inspector for content, geometry, colors, and edge routing
- Sandboxed HTML/CSS/Three.js cards represented as standard file nodes
- Canvas-aware copilot with local tools or a client-side OpenAI-compatible provider
- Prompt-first AI notes that generate Markdown directly onto the canvas
- Reactive AI operator cards: connected nodes become inputs and generated notes refresh when inputs change
- Library filters
- Browser-local persistence
- JSON Canvas `.canvas` import/export and whole-space `.orbit.json` backup/restore
- No runtime dependencies or build step
- Locally vendored BASM / Pixel Loom Linen tokens and self-hosted fonts

## Run locally

Serve the directory with any static file server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open <http://localhost:4173>.

## Controls

| Action | Control |
|---|---|
| Pan | Hold `Space` and drag, middle-drag, or use the hand tool |
| Zoom | Mouse wheel, `+`, or `-` |
| Enter sub-canvas | Double-click its portal, choose **Open**, or zoom over it past 220% |
| Return to parent | Zoom all the way out, choose a breadcrumb, or press `Alt + ↑` |
| Fit view | `0` |
| Add note | Double-click empty canvas or press `N` and click |
| Connect | Drag any side handle to another card, or press `C` and select two nodes |
| Select | `V` |
| Delete | `Delete` / `Backspace` |
| Open Johnny Decimal index | Select **JD** beside Canvases or press `Ctrl/Cmd + K` |
| Export current canvas | `Ctrl/Cmd + S` |
| Export all canvases | Select **Export whole space** in the sidebar |

## Johnny Decimal spaces

Select **JD** beside the Canvases heading. Orbit determines the next valid level from the selected parent:

```text
Index
└── 10–19 — Personal          area
    └── 11 — Finance          category
        ├── 11.01 — Budget    item note
        └── 11.02 — Taxes     item canvas
```

Area, category, and canvas-item portals remain standard JSON Canvas file nodes. Item notes store their identifier in a harmless Markdown comment and heading. IDs are checked for the correct parent range, duplicates are rejected, and the canvas hierarchy is sorted numerically. The same dialog provides direct **Go to ID** navigation.

## Connect an AI provider

Open **Ask Orbit → ⚙ AI provider settings**. For Mistral, use:

```text
API base URL: https://api.mistral.ai/v1
Model:        mistral-small-latest
API key:      your Mistral API key
```

The static app calls the provider directly with `fetch()` using its OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint. The model receives the current canvas and proposes typed operations; changes are validated and require confirmation before being applied.

### AI notes

Select **AI note** in the sidebar. Orbit asks for your prompt before creating anything, sends it directly to the configured provider, and places the Markdown response near the center of the current view as a standard JSON Canvas text node.

### AI operator cards

1. Add an **AI operator** from the left sidebar.
2. Edit its instructions in the inspector.
3. Connect input notes into the operator: select the connect tool, click an input, then click the AI card.
4. It runs after the connection is added; use **Run now** whenever you want a manual refresh.

The operator creates a standard text note and a labeled `AI output` connection. Changes to an input note are debounced and regenerate the same output note automatically. Connection cycles pause automatic execution to prevent request loops.

By default, the key lives in `sessionStorage` for the current tab. Enabling **Remember API key** places it in `localStorage`. This client-only mode is intended for personal testing on a trusted device.

## Data model

Each canvas remains a JSON Canvas 1.0 document with only the top-level `nodes` and `edges` arrays. A sub-canvas portal is a standard file node pointing to a child document under `canvases/`; Johnny Decimal portals use readable paths such as `canvases/11-finance.canvas`. Orbit's browser-local workspace sidecar tracks hierarchy, titles, Johnny Decimal identifiers, and camera positions without adding private fields to canvas objects.

**Export .canvas** exports the currently open level. **Export whole space** produces an `.orbit.json` backup containing the sidecar and every standards-compliant canvas document; the normal Import action restores either format.

Life-management meaning is encoded portably:

- text and Markdown task lists in text nodes
- preset canvas colors as lightweight categories
- groups as areas of focus or time horizons
- edges as dependencies and relationships

App-specific state such as viewport, filters, and UI selection is not added to exported documents.

## Direction for a full application

This project is intentionally built with browser standards and no UI framework or runtime dependencies. A production app can continue in that direction with:

- ES modules, Custom Elements, DOM templates, CSS custom properties, Pointer Events, SVG, Canvas, and WebGL
- a command-based canvas engine for selection, geometry, JSON Canvas updates, undo, and sync
- IndexedDB and the File System Access API in the browser
- **Tauri 2** for a small desktop app with filesystem and SQLite access
- **Capacitor** as an optional mobile shell around the same web application
- `.canvas` files as the portable format while indexed task/calendar projections remain app metadata

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the standards-first application design, [`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md) for the BASM / Pixel Loom integration, and [`docs/generative-canvas.md`](docs/generative-canvas.md) for the live-card, partial-update, AI-operation, and security model.
